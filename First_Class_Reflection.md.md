# how I am planning on working this quarter

I plan on using my own computer and working during class as well as outside of class at home

# did I have any issues

I did not have any issues, although I will definitely need to remember how to do this and redo a lot of stuff.

# How did the Unix Tutorial go? Do you feel like you are understanding how to access and navigate through your computer’s file structure? Are there any commands you practiced that are confusing or did you hit any “roadblocks”?

- the command ls -F isn't working for any PC users
- when changing directories (using CD), I can go to some folders/directories but not others. for instance I can go to downloads but not desktop. in my users/isaac folder on my computer I see all of the files when I use ls on users/isaac including desktop, but LS shows me all of them besides desktop.
- I have never done coding before and it's really annoying having this be streamlined for mac even though I know most programming lang

# What is one goal you have for the quarter?

I want to be able to learn how to code well enough to be able to do something relavent to my studies
